#Run npm install to install all the packages and dependecies


#I dont have your social media urls , and I dont know what acountes are you use, so I used fb ,insta, linkedin and reaserch gate , If you dont want to use one of them in your website you can go to components/infocard/socialmediasvg
and delete what you want after that go to Socialmedia.js and delete the anchor tag , and don't forget to put your urls in the href attribute


When you finish run "npm run build" to get the finit product to put it in the internet

#Thanks and Enjoy .
